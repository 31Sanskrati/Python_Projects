# Python Projects Playground

> Put On Your Python Hat and Get Ready to Rock!

Welcome to the Python Playground! This repository contains a collection of Python projects and scripts for you to explore and experiment with. Each project has its own folder, and you can dive in and start coding right away. Some projects are beginner-friendly, while others are more advanced and challenging. I am a Python learner and this is the playground created by me and various other awesome people.
